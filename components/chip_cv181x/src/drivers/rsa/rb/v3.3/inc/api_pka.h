 *
 * A_Len
 * B_Len
 * Extra
 *     Three 16-bit values. The meaning depends on the OpCode. Typically,
 *     A_Len and B_Len will describe the length of the vector components and

 *
 * Encrypted
 *     This parameter is used to describe which of the input vector components

 *     DMA Buffer Handles to the blocks of memory that are used as input or
 *     output for the operation. The exact number of handles and use is

 *     it would be fixed to one format (little endian, which means the least
 *     significant part of the big integer must be first in the buffer) and
 *     either an array of bytes or array of 32bit words with clearly specified
