 * Device_Read32
 *
 * This function can be used to read one static 32bit resource inside a device
 * (typically a register or memory location). Since reading registers can have
 * side effects, the implementation must guarantee that the resource will be
 * read only once and no neighboring resources will be accessed.
 *
 * If required (decided based on internal configuration), on the fly endianness
 * swapping of the value read will be performed before it is returned to the
 * caller.
 *
 * Device (input)
 *     Handle for the device instance as returned by Device_Find.
 *
 * ByteOffset (input)
 *     The byte offset within the device for the resource to read.
 *
 * Return Value
 *     The value read.
 *
 * When the Device or Offset parameters are invalid, the implementation will
 * return an unspecified value.

 * will be written exactly once and no neighboring resources will be
 * accessed.

 * swapping of the value to be written will be performed.

 * Device (input)
 *     Handle for the device instance as returned by Device_Find.

 *     The byte offset within the device for the resource to write.

 * Value (input)
 *     The 32bit value to write.
 *
 * Return Value
 *     None
 *
 * The write can only be successful when the Device and ByteOffset parameters
 * are valid.
