# Using Service with Custom TDL

## Using with Service

If you follow the format in chapter 4, you'll be able to put your structure directly into any service function. For example, you can call ``DrawRect`` after your own face detection.

```c
cvtdl_face_t faceMeta;
YOUR_OWN_FACE_DETECTION(frame, &faceMeta);
CVI_TDL_Service_FaceDrawRect(&faceMeta, frame);
// ... Output result to screen ...
```
